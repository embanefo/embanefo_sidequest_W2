Karen Cochrane and David Han and Ebube Mbanefo - embanefo - 20931125

## Description

Adds several rectangular platforms. The blob is drawn as a noisy circle but collides using a simple axis-aligned bounding box (AABB). X and Y are resolved separately to keep behaviour predictable and teachable.

## Ebube Mbanefo created a fork of Karen and David's code for this version and changed the colour of the blob and background to portray the emotion: sadness. No GenAI was used.

## Learning Goals

Learning Goals:

- Convert a circular sprite to an AABB for collision
- Implement overlap test and push-out resolution
- Manage grounded state only when landing on top faces

---

## Assets

N/A

---

## GenAI

The code was written by Dr. Karen Cochrane but she used GenAI to write the comments.
